		<h2>Anime: A visual feast for the eyes and mind</h2>
		<p>
			Japanese animation, which I will refer to as Anime, is a visual wonder. Anime has been around since the beginning of the 21st century. There is something for everyone and I've been watching it for over two decades now and still watch it more than any other genre of TV show or movie. Anime has been used in popular live action movies like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/">Kill Bill: Vol. 1</a> and the recent box office hit <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219827/">Ghost in the Shell</a>. If you are interested in watching anime, look no further then the several streaming services from <a href="https://www.funimation.com/">Funimation</a> to <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/">Crunchyroll</a>. This blog isn't here to conveniece vistors to become Anime fan girls and boys, but to expose you to why anime has become as popular as it is currently. Please take your time to become familiar with the pages below as we take a trip down memory lane as I delight you with my experiences as a young curious child who loved watching cartoons.
