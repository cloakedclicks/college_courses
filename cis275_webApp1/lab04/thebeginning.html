        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in the 80's watching Saturday morning cartoons. I can still taste those sugary sweet cereals,
            so sweet the sugar would be eating your teeth away as you were watching cartoons eating the cereal.
            I watched everything from TunderCats to Transformers, but there is definitely more than meets the eye with
            this beginning story.
        </p>
        <p>
            So how did I get from the typical 80's Saturday morning cartoons to Anime, I can sum
            it all up in one word VOLTRON! As I type that title in my mind I can hear the phrase so loud and clear!
            What phrase you ask? The one and only phase there is to know if you were a Voltron fan,
            &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZv5Z2Iz_s">Ready to form Voltron</a>, Activate Interlock,
            Dynatherms Connected, Intercells Up, Megathrusters are Go! GO VOLTRON FORCE!!&rdquo; This cartoon was by far
            my favorite Saturday morning cartoon. I had the action figures, the pajamas, the &ldquo;Blazing&rdquo; sword.
            20 years later and I'm still buying Voltron merchandise. Voltron was my gateway into the world of Anime.
        </p>
        <h3>The Defender of the Universe</h3>

        </figure>
        <p>
            HeMan may have been the Strongest Man in the Universe, but in America Voltron was THE Defender of the
            Universe. Voltron was originally called &ldquo;Go Lion&rdquo; in Japan. The original series wasn't the most
            kid friendly anime. As most anime from Japan, before it comes over to the United States awesomeness of Japanese culture has
            to be scrubbed off and life concepts dumbed down for the American audience. Of course
            this is only my opinion. Since the 2000s there were a few failed attempts to remake Voltron. In my opinion
            those failed attempts were:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164303/"> Third Dimension (1998)</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1669774/"> Voltron Force (2011)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        These shows paled in comparision of both the Americanized Voltron and the original Go Lion from Japan. Luckily
        an awesome company called Dreamworks came along and did a remake which brought back fans young and old of the
        original series. If you haven't seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580664/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">Voltron:
        Legendary
        Defender (2016)</a></li> you should definitely check it out. It's a Neflix original and it is worth the binge.
        </p>
        <h3>Anime's of the 80's</h3>
        <p>
            Voltron was my start, but there were many other Anime's around the 80's that are definitely worth watching.
            If you haven't seen these before and you are curious about Anime's, these are some classics worth mentioning.
